# ApolloTestAssignment

This is a simple project that allows user to scan nearby bluetooth devices and displays them on the screen as well a shows a list of pre defined products available for purchase in app.

To run this project simply clone it to your local machine, build and run on a device or simulator.

This project contains no external spm or pod dependecies so no extra manipulations needed. 

Assesment Sidenotes: 

- This project does note implement swiftgen for assets since it's an overkill for such a tiny app.
- Images of products in store are contain both images and texts on the image as a single PNG file, it's not a prod app approach but for this particular view is was done this way to save up time to meet the deadline.
